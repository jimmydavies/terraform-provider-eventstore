# Eventstore Provider
The eventstore terraform provider is used to interact with and manage resources in a self hosted eventstore cluster. This is currently a very early iteration and support only the following areas
 - Managing Users
 - Configuring Persistant Subscriptions


## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    eventstore = {
      source = "malachantrio/eventstore"
      version = "0.0.6"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
}

provider "eventstore" {
  url = "http://eventstore.mydomain.com:2113"
  username = "admin"
  password = "supersecret"
}
```
!> **Warning:** Hard-coded credentials are not recommended in any Terraform
configuration and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a
public version control system. Please always provide credentials via the 
appropriate environment variables.

## Argument Reference
 - `url` - URL to connect to eventstore with. This should contain both the protocol and any port required to connect e.g. `http://eventstore.mydomain.com:2113`. Can also be set with the `EVENTSTORE_URL` environment variable.
 - `username` - Username to connect to eventstore with. This user should have enough permissions to perform the actions you are asking the provider to perform. Can also be set with the `EVENTSTORE_USERNAME` environment variable.
